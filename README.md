Great clarification! Since this `README.md` is for your **client** to understand the project, and you've mentioned that **tour agents (users) provide the tours**, while **admins only approve them** (not create them), here's a fully revised and polished `README.md` tailored to clearly explain the platform for **your client**:

```markdown
# 🌍 Tour Booking Platform

A full-stack tour booking system where travel agents can register and submit tours, users can book tours, and admins manage approvals and monitor activity. This document provides a complete overview of how the platform works.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simplify the process of offering and booking tours:
- Tour agents can submit tours.
- Customers can book available tours.
- Admins approve or reject submitted tours and oversee all activities.

---

## 🧭 User Flow (Client-Friendly Overview)

### 1. 👥 **User Registration & Login**
- **Two types of users**:
  - **Tour Providers (Agents)** – can create and submit tour listings.
  - **Customers** – can browse and book tours.
- Secure registration and login using email and password.

---

### 2. 📤 **Tour Submission (By Agents)**
- Agents can log in and:
  - Submit a new tour by filling a form with:
    - Tour name, image, description, price, date, location, available seats, etc.
  - View status of submitted tours:
    - **Pending**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**

---

### 3. ✅ **Admin Approval**
- Admin reviews all new tour submissions.
- Tours will only be shown to customers **after admin approval**.
- Admin actions:
  - Approve or reject tours.
  - Monitor bookings and users.

---

### 4. 🔎 **Browse & View Tours (For Customers)**
- Customers can view all **approved tours**.
- Filter by destination, price, date, etc.
- Click on a tour to see:
  - Full details, images, pricing, availability, and agent info.

---

### 5. 🛒 **Booking a Tour**
- Customers click **“Book Now”**.
- Confirm tour details.
- Booking will be saved in their account.

---

### 6. 📋 **User Dashboard**
- Customers see:
  - All their booked tours.
  - Status (upcoming, completed, or canceled).
  - Option to cancel or request to **swap tour** (if enabled).

---

### 7. 🔁 **Tour Swap (Optional Feature)**
- Customers can request to swap to another tour if something comes up.
- The system finds alternatives and allows switching if slots are available.

---

### 8. 🛠 **Admin Panel**
- Admin functionalities include:
  - Approve or reject new tour submissions
  - Manage all users and bookings
  - Handle tour swap requests (if applicable)
  - Access platform analytics (optional)
